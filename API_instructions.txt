2. In the CoppeliaSim installed files:
	2.1 On the path  "programming/remoteApiBindings/lib/lib/Ubuntu18_04/"" copy RemoteApi.so* 
		to your folder;
	2.2 On the path  "programming/remoteApiBindings/octave/octave/" copy remApiSetup.m
		to your folder;
	2.3 Copy all files from path "programming/include/" to folder "programming/remoteApiBindings/	    octave/";
	2.4 Copy all files from path "programming/remoteApi/" to folder "programming/remoteApiBindings/		octave/".
3. Open the Octave and change the directory for "programming/remoteApiBindings/octave/". Execute 	   buildLin.m**.
4. When executing the previous file, a new file will appear in the directory: "remApi.oct". Copy the 	new file to your folder.
